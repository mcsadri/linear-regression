**Author**: [Manuch S.](https://github.com/mcsadri)  
**Input**: [2,2k+ Scotch Whisky Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koki25ando/22000-scotch-whisky-reviews): a dataset including 2,2k+ Scotch Whisky reviews (originally collected from the Whisky Advocate database.

## Overview

Performing exploratory analysis by using Linear Regressions on a Kaggle data set.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- [ ] Select a Kaggle data set that is suitable for Linear Regression.
    - Note make sure the data set is stored as csv file/s.
    - Data set must be continous values appropriate for a Linear Regression. If you’re not sure then ask Instructor or TA.
- [ ] Load the data you receive into a Pandas DataFrame.
- [ ] Show the first five rows of the data set.
- [ ] Show the description and the info of the data set.
- [ ] Ensure that any date columns have been cast into a datetime object in your DataFrame.
- [ ] Using a regression model, split your data into train and test portions.
- [ ] Fit your training split to the regression model.
- [ ] Show your regression model’s score.
- [ ] Draw at least three conclusions from your regression model.
- [ ] Your notebook should be clutter free and polished.

## UAT

No acceptance tests today, but Notebook should clearly display its conclusions.
